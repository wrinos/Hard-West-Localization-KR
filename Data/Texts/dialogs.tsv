s2_cass_escape	Cervantes wondered if sending Perez after Cassandra was the best course of action.	s2_cass_escape_00	5	1	death
s2_cass_escape	Even so, he was not one to let go of a grudge. The clairvoyant had to die.	s2_cass_escape_01	5	1	death
s2_cass_escape	He and Sister Rosa would have to do without Perez’s protection from now on.	s2_cass_escape_02	5	1	death
s2_indian_targets	Every member of the Order they knew of was dead.	s2_indian_targets_00	5	1	death

s2_after_shaman	Sister Rosa had vanished, but Cervantes had neither the time nor means to pursue her.	s2_after_shaman_02	5	1	death

s2_house_ritual_complete	The blast from the meteor could be heard for hundreds of miles.	s2_house_ritual_complete_00	5	1	death
s2_house_ritual_complete	It melted off Raum’s flesh to reveal his true form: an abomination; a demon.	s2_house_ritual_complete_01	5	1	death

s5_t3_obj3	He knew that certain physical substances, like mercury, could cause Madness.	s5_t3_obj3_02	4	1	death
s5_t3_obj3	If that were true, then the plague could have a physical source.	s5_t3_obj3_03	4	1	death

s5_t4_start	Trumercliff thought his "death" was actually a rebirth through the meteor's power.	s5_t4_start_01	4	1	death
s5_t4_start	Obviously he had been insane. But what had he been trying to communicate?	s5_t4_start_02	4	1	death
s5_t4_start2	One thing was clear. Trumercliff had renounced his old mind and embraced genius.	s5_t4_start2_00	4	1	death

s5_t5_start	DeLear was putting the final touches on his masterpiece when the madmen closed in.	s5_t5_start_00	4	1	death
s5_t5_start	If he could get power to the machine, it would invert the meteor's energy.	s5_t5_start_01	4	1	death
s5_t5_start	It might cure them, it might kill them. Either way it would stop them.	s5_t5_start_02	4	1	death

s5_end	The power of the meteor, now inverted, invaded every mind in the area.	s5_end_01	4	1	death
s5_end	All in the vicinity were cleansed of madness, but in its place, only blanks remained.	s5_end_02	4	1	death
