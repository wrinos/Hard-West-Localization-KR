	Scenario 3 corrections	
s3_random_seamstress_desc1	The posse came across a very peculiar man who walked slowly and clumsily and stank of death. The card sewn in his clothes read: "Severen Graves".<br><br>The man walked straight up to the Undertaker and handed him an envelope.<br><br>When asked about the contents, he pointed toward his sewn-shut mouth and walked away.	
s3_seamstress_resurect	The Undertaker presented the Old Seamstress with a lock of hair. The witch mixed the hair with herbs while muttering spells in an unknown tongue.<br><br>She spent many hours at it before giving up. She said she had never seen a curse this strong. It was as though it came from the Lord of Hell himself. She knew no way of lifting it.<br><br>Before the Undertaker could reply, the Seamstress touched Harrington's forehead and he fell unconscious. When he awoke, his aging eyesight was rejuvenated and he felt reborn.
