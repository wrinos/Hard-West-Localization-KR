	Main plot strategic events	
s1_intro	After the fray	
s1_intro_desc	The stranger approached you again.<br><br>He said he knew the Masked Man's location, but that telling you would "spoil the sportsmanship of the hunt."<br><br>You didn't pay it much mind. You knew that if you took enough money from him, he'd find you.	
s1_intro_desc3	The stranger asked if you'd met any of your enemy's enemies. Said he'd heard tell of an old man named Murray. Seems he ran the Gin Mill and had crossed the Masked Man somehow. Tracking him down might put you closer to your target.	
s1_intro_desc4	Then the stranger made an ominous request. He said that if you took 100 lives he would reward you handsomely.	
fear_rises	Fear rises	
fear_level1	As the bounty on your head increased, people in the area wanted less and less to do with you. The shop owners raised prices 10 percent, hoping you'd take your business elsewhere.	
fear_level2	The reward on your head attracted bounty hunters from far off places. Let 'em. It was their funeral. Still, anytime you went anywhere now, it seemed there were more enemies to contend with.	
fear_level3	Terror spread through the land. Many of the shop owners just up and left town, closing their shops for good.	
damage_done	Damaging properties	
damage_level1	You killed, burned and terrorized, but you still couldn't find much information about the Masked Man. Seems they still feared him more than you. Time to fix that.	
damage_level2	Intimidation and destruction served you well. As you became more fearsome, the people you interrogated seemed to know more and more. You were moving up the chain. Still, the location of the Masked Man's hideout remained a secret.	
damage_level3	Finally, you knew the Masked Man's location: his oil field.	
death_toll	Death toll	
death_toll_desc	The stranger showed up right on cue. Congratulated you on a job well done.<br><br>Then he offered a boon of your choosing.

s1_spiritcompany	Murray Spirit Company	
s1_spiritcompany_desc	You arrived at Old Man Murray's gin mill to find the place ruined, deserted and covered in crates.<br><br>The upper floor office remained suspended but looked like it would fall apart any second. You figured you could grab one thing and get out. But should you get the money from the safe or the curious glass item on the desk?	
s1_spiritcompany_cash	You took the cash from the safe.	g
s1_spiritcompany_item	You took the glass item.	g
s1_spiritcompany_desc_tem	As you grabbed the item from the desk, the floor lurched and a low rumble heralded the office's imminent demise. You leaped from the room as it collapsed into rubble on the floor below.<br><br>You inspected the loot. Turned out to be just a strange old monocle.	
s1_spiritcompany_desc_cash	As you grabbed the cash from the safe, the floor lurched and a low rumble heralded the office's imminent demise. You leaped from the room as it collapsed into rubble on the floor below.<br><br>You inspected the loot - not a bad chunk of tin.	
s1_poachinggrounds	Poaching Grounds	
s1_poachinggrounds_desc	The forests in Indian country teemed with game, more than the natives could ever catch, let alone eat. Which made them easy pickings for poachers.<br><br>The ground was riddled with their traps. On a lucky day you could disarm them and steal the bait. On a bad day you'd catch a broken finger, a gashed hand, or worse.<br><br>Maybe it would be simpler just to stake out the traps and wait for the poachers to show. Nothing like stealing from a thief.

s1_poachinggrounds_desc_trap3	As you tried to pick the trap, lady luck showed you her bad side.	
s1_poachinggrounds_wait	You set up an ambush for the poachers and settled in for a wait.	g
s1_poachinggrounds_desc_wait	Finally the poachers showed. You took them out like clockwork, except for one.<br><br>At first he refused to talk, but some creative pain mismanagement took care of that. Once he knew you were serious, he told you Old Man Murray was alive, but had been captured. He said the Masked Man had left him with the rednecks living at Rancho Rojo, then paused for effect.<br><br>Seeing your puzzled face, the poacher added solemnly: "they eat people."	
gunsmith_shop	Gunsmith Shoppe	
gunsmith_shop_desc	You entered the shop, a dozen of suspicious eyes burning holes in you.<br><br>A giant of a man presented himself as Mr. Dorias, the proprietor. He wanted you to know you were "personally" invited to shop in his place.	
gunsmith_shop_desc_return	O. Dorias' gunsmith shop offered a decent selection of firearms. This time you attracted less unwanted attention.	
gunsmith_shop_desc_goback	Mr. Dorias asked if'n you needed anything else.

gunsmith_shop_shotgun_opt1	You figured two barrels are better than one ([%0])	p10cash
gunsmith_shop_shotgun_opt2	What's better than two barrels? Three barrels. ([%0])	p20cash
gunsmith_shop_shotgun_opt3	Three barrels was good, but four was juuuuust right. ([%0])	p40cash
gunsmith_shop_shotgun_opt5	You shook your head.	x
gunsmith_shop_shotgun_opt6	You left the shop.	x
gunsmith_shop_desc_ask	The old gunsmith explained that if there was one thing that bothered the Masked Man, it was losing money. He'd started getting suspicious Murray was skimming money. And when the Masked Man got suspicious, he didn't waste time wondering what to do.	
elixir_trader	Elixir Trader’s	
elixir_trader_desc	Jeremiah Benjamin Baker sold all kinds of cures, balms and ointments. If their smell was to be believed, most of them were a variation on bottled urine.	
elixir_trader_barter	You browsed his shop anyway.	b
elixir_trader_leave	You decided not to waste any more time on the old charlatan.	x
elixir_trader_inquire	You asked Baker about the cannibal farm.	g
elixir_trader_desc_inquire	The shopkeeper revealed the maneaters sometimes came to him looking for meat-tenderizers and exotic herbs.<br><br>If you wanted, he could send a letter of introduction, telling them you were one of them. That way you could approach them without raising the alarm.<br><br>Every favor has a price, though. He'd only do it if you helped him test his new potion.	
elixir_trader_inquire2	You agreed to take a sip of his vile concoction.	g
elixir_trader_desc_inquire2	A nauseating wave rushed through your body. Your face felt hot, then your entire body cramped up and you fell to the ground in agony. When it subsided, he apologized profusely, insisting you keep the rest as a make-good.<br><br>He'd send the letter immediately.	
hanged_slave	Hanged Slave	
hanged_slave_desc	You encountered a hanged man, a runaway slave by the look of him. A voodoo talisman was tied around his wrist. You remembered your father grim face when he told you it was bad luck to touch a hanged man.	
hanged_slave_opt1	You decided to bury him.	g
hanged_slave_opt1_result	Giving him a proper burial felt like the right the to do, but your personal satisfaction was the only profit you got from it.	
hanged_slave_opt2	You took the talisman.	g
hanged_slave_opt2_result	As you took the talisman you felt a deep chill run down your spine.	
outlaw_joint	Old John Kraimer’s Inn	
outlaw_joint_desc	Kraimer's dilapidated joint played host to a rowdy bunch of ugly-mugged drunkards. <br><br>And it was your lucky day. Sitting at the bar was one of the Masked Man's thugs that killed you.

outlaw_joint_barter	You bought liquor.	b
outlaw_joint_leave	You left while you were still standing.	x
outlaw_joint_desc_getthug	You stabbed the thug in the back. As ladies screamed and men rose to their feet, you dragged him outside by his collar. After a little more persuasion, he spilled the beans on the Masked Man's locations and operations.	
outlaw_joint_desc_getthug2	The thug gave you directions to the Masked Man's homestead and cattle pasture.	
outlaw_joint_desc_getthug3	He said the Masked Man also owned an excavation site and an old sawmill, but was in the dark about the location of the Masked Man himself.	
outlaw_joint_desc_getthug4	Begging you to spare his life, he told you of a gold transport waiting to be picked up from the bank in Aspirton. He warned you that the Masked Man had a deal with some demons to protect it. If they got a telegraph message, or the church bell tolled seven times, they'd swoop in like... well, like demons. <br><br>When he finished, you promised you wouldn't kill him. Then you slit his throat.	
outlaw_joint_keeptalking	...	
outlaw_joint_desc_drink	Drops of whiskey dripped through the holes in your face.<br>The liquor filled your mouth with fire and your heart with courage.	
outlaw_joint_desc_drinkbest	Drops of whiskey dripped through the holes in your face.<br>It was mighty fine hooch. You felt like you could take on the world.	
outlaw_joint_desc_eat	The stew tasted funny and smelled funnier. You couldn't recognize the meat, and no one would tell you what it was. But it was that or seek vengeance on an empty stomach.	
outlaw_joint_desc_murray	Old Man Murray looked like he was drinking to forget. While you were checking the Inn out, he just sat in the back, downing glass after glass of the worst poison they had, muttering about someone named Roberta.	
outlaw_joint_leave2	You helped him out.	
ghost_town	The ghost town of Hope	
ghost_town_desc	Rumor had it the whole town had died of plague in a single week. With the sickness in the air and the bodies on the ground, no one dared to loot the place.

ghost_town_opt1_result	You found some loot, but there was something in the air. Your breath became heavier and slower.	
ghost_town_opt2	You burned the place down and searched the remains.	g
ghost_town_opt2_result	You found some valuables in the ashes.	
ghost_town_desc_crone	Suddenly, an old hag approached, squawking like a preacher. She said the city was a grave; but not all citizens were buried in it. Seven men were buried in the forest.<br><br>Six decent folk and one thief buried with his loot.	
ghost_town_desc_crone2	She said if you dug up the thief's grave, you'd be rich beyond measure.<br><br>Touch the wrong grave though, and you'd be cursed. Bad luck would haunt you, sickness would crush your bones and spirits would follow you forever.<br><br>She vanished, leaving you alone with the memorial marker.

miners_house	The Southwest Mining Company excavation site.	
miners_house_desc	Prospectors in the area had teamed up with Masked Man to form the Southwest Mining Company. You could collapse just the entrance for an immediate short-term effect. Or you could blow it up top to bottom to put it out of commission forever. That would take longer and there would be far greater risk of injury.	
miners_house_collapse	You collapsed the entrance.	g
miners_house_collapse_result	With the mine entrance blocked, the mining operation stopped for a while, severely impacting the Masked Man's funds.	
miners_house_blowup	You blew up the entire mine.	g
miners_house_blowup_result	You were injured in the explosion, but it was worth it. The mine was completely destroyed. The Masked Man would be furious when he heard about this.

grave_01_desc	Here lies Sam Courtney, a skilled [unreadable].<br><br>Sam had been found stabbed to death in his house, with no indication of struggle.<br>The investigation discovered that he'd been testing his new stab-proof jacket.	
grave_dig	You dug it up.	g
grave_leave	You left.	x
grave_01_result	You dug up the bones of an enormous man. He must have been the blacksmith. With him, you found a vest made of some kind of leather you hadn't seen before.	
grave_02	Mossy grave	
grave_02_desc	The grave was covered in fresh moss, a pristine green carpet flecked with morning dew. <br><br>The only readable part of the epitaph was "...a fine merchant."	
grave_02_result	You dug up a skeleton wearing a merchant's finery, a vial of potion beside him. The card in his pocket read "Timothy McDonald."	
grave_03	Cracked grave	
grave_03_desc	Someone had tried to dig this grave up, but left in a hurry.<br><br>A note was nailed to the cross: "Seeking this man's lawful heir. Contact me. - Romney Tate."	
grave_03_result	You dug up a thick-boned skeleton, by all appearances a cook. There was something stashed there... maybe it was still edible.	
grave_04	Lonely grave	
grave_04_desc	This grave bore just a simple cross, and did not appear well-tended. <br><br>A name was carved on it: "Faryn Brygo"	
grave_04_result	There was nothing there, apart from the skeleton. You figured this must be the spot. As you dug deeper, your shovel thudded on a wooden chest. The thief's loot was yours.	
grave_05	Poor grave	
grave_05_desc	This grave was poor as could be, though the meadow flowers around it meant he'd been loved.<br><br>You weren't sure why, but you have a feeling this was the grave of a farmer.	
grave_05_result	As goes the grave, so goes the man: poor. A name was sewn in the lining of his coat: Stephen Teague. The only other item present was a bottle of liquor.	
grave_06	Grimy grave	
grave_06_desc	The grave was dirty and foul, filled with broken bottles and other debris.<br><br>The headstone read: Donovan Byrnes.	
grave_06_result	The skeleton was unremarkable, except for one solid gold tooth. Must have been a miner.	
grave_07	Mucky grave	
grave_07_desc	This was a burial site, but not what you'd call a proper grave.	
grave_07_result	As expected, there were no fine clothes, gold or valuables here. But you did find a derringer. To your surprise, you also found a card saying: "Romney Tate, Judge."	
s1_grave_pinkerton	Pinkerton grave	
s1_grave_pinkerton_desc	You came across a mass grave, labeled with the famous detective company's mark. Many an agent who had perished in the field lay there.	
s1_grave_pinkerton_desc_dig	You found many valuables, but your karma felt like it'd been on a three day bender.	
indian_totem	Indian totem of a despicable god	
indian_totem_desc	Beneath the totem lay a hoard of gold, precious stones and jewelry.<br>A screaming eagle carved into the totem spoke, posessed by a spiteful deity. It whispered that it wanted one of your companions. And that it would reward you greatly.

old_sawmill	Old Sawmill	
old_sawmill_desc	The old sawmill was no longer in use, its tall buildings fallen into wobbly disrepair. There would be lumberjack tools inside, but you didn't know if you should press your luck.	
old_sawmill_leave	You turned reluctantly away.	x
old_sawmill_taketools	The precarious building contained a saw.	g
old_sawmill_desc_lucky	You were successful in retrieving the tools, but it felt like your luck was running out.	p

old_sawmill_leave2	You left the sawmill.	x

hermit_hut_desc_giveall	You couldn't tell if the Hermit was high or just crazy, but he told you of a spot where he'd found more treasure than he could carry. If you went there, you could retrieve the rest.	
big_tree	Big Tree	
big_tree_desc	This was the tree the natives had been talking about. You were ready to take it down.	
big_tree_desc_nosaw	This was the tree the natives had been talking about. If you had the right tools you could cut it down.	
big_tree_nosaw	With no tools to cut the tree down, you left.	x
big_tree_saw	You started cutting through the tree with the saw.	g
big_tree_desc_saw	You sawed until your hands were covered in blisters.<br><br>Finally, in the center of the tree, you found a set of human bones. You took them to the natives who made a powerful charm from unlucky man's bones.	
big_tree_leave	You walked away.	x
water_tower	Water Tower	
water_tower_desc	The water tower was the linchpin of Cannibal Farm.<br><br>You could have spilled the water to damage the Masked Man's property.<br>Or you could have poisoned the water to weaken the cannibals.

water_tower_spillwater_result	You smiled as the contents of the tower spilled out and quickly disappeared into the parched earth.<br>This wouldn't be enough to prevent the Masked Man's men from working, but their hard times would become even harder.	
farm	Cannibal Farm	
farm_desc	The farm looked innocent enough. But you knew better than to trust appearances.<br><br>The cannibals had heavy sentries at the entrances. You hadn't seen a trace of Murray yet. Chances are they had him locked away somewhere.	
farm_desc_return	You returned to Cannibal Farm. Things looked normal. They didn't expect an attack.

town	Aspirton

judge_homestead_takeenslave	You took the valuables, enslaving whoever you could along the way.	g
judge_homestead_desc_takeenslave	They were good stock. With one hand you stole their valuables, with the other, you herded them into a room. There, you tied their hands and cuffed their necks to a chain. Then you marched them out to the forest and across the marshes for two days and two nights. On the third day you reached the slavers, who were more than happy to compensate you for your trouble. And your excellent merchandise.	
judge_homestead_kill	You focused on killing the servants.	g
judge_homestead_desc_kill	You walked from room to room, shooting everything that moved. While some managed to get away, often with the most valuable goods, you added many kills to your tally and found many trinkets of value.	
judge_homestead_burn	You burned down the house with everything and everyone inside.	g
judge_homestead_desc_burn	You circled the house, barring the exits and smashing every oil lamp you found. Undetected, you lit a cigarette, enjoying the tickle of smoke through the holes in your face.

The screams of those being burned alive filled the night like a symphony, occasionally interrupted by suicidal gunshots.	
judge_homestead_leave	You left the homestead behind.	x

s1_blindgunman_desc2	Suddenly you heard the crack of a shot, and a bullet tore your side. Seeking cover, you glanced back to see the blind gunman you robbed so long ago wearing a placid smile and scenting the air for another shot.<br><br>You plunged into the stream and let it carry you away. Hopefully the water would foil his fiendish nose.	
s1_blindgunman_desc3	You managed to get away.	
indian_tent	Indian Camp

s1_hospital_descmurray	The natives could put any gunslinger back together with their rituals and herbal medicine if the price was right.<br><br>Except Old Man Murray.

s1_hospital_desc_offerwhiskey	You sat a few hours, drinking and smoking with the natives.<br><br>Around midnight, the real stories began to unwind. You heard tell of a sinister deity living in the forest. And a totem representing it not far away.	
s1_hospital_desc_offerwhiskey2	The natives told a tale of an old hermit who lived in a secluded hut. Word was he'd found a treasure of incredible value, but fearing the envy of others had kept to himself and was thus unable to enjoy his own riches.

s1_hospital_inquire	You inquired about Old Man Murray.	
s1_hospital_desc_inquire	The natives knew many old men, but no Murrays. They said the only white folk around those parts were the Masked Man's thugs, who poached from the nearby forest.

s1_scrawnykid_desc	As you traveled down a lonesome road, the blood of your victims still smeared on your palms, a scrawny teenager stepped out of the bushes and accused you of killing his parents. You said you didn't rightly remember, but you'd killed so many people at that point, the odds were with him.<br>He didn't look like much of a threat, but from the pure hatred burning in his eyes you could tell that what he lacked in brawn, he made up with in determination.
