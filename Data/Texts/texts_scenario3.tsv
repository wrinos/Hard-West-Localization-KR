s3_ghosttown_optional_title	Light of the dead	
s3_ghostown_optional_completed	In the morning, the Undertaker noticed that one of the candles he saved from the Demon Prince was still lit. In fact it  didn't look to have shrunk one bit.

s3p_hermit_what_now	The Hermit smiled mysteriously, but did not reply.<br><br>The Undertaker begged, pleaded, cursed and threatened, but Empus was impenetrable. Resigned, the gravedigger decided to return to Ghost Town and take his own life to avoid causing any more harm.
