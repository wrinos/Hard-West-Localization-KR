s9_t2_intro	Yes, your hands were quite mangled in the fall. But in any case, your new ones are far superior.	s9_t2_intro_01	3	0	morbid
s9_t2_intro	Superior?! These are Fred Glass's hands, you bastard!	s9_t2_intro_02	3	0	libertee
s9_t2_firstkill	Your armed goons were closing in. But I don't die easy.	s9_t2_firstkill	3	0	libertee

s9_t2_healed	Whatever was in that tank, it kicked like a mule.	s9_t2_healed	3	0	libertee
s9_t2_falsetracks	After that I knew we wouldn't be followed.	s9_t2_falsetracks	3	0	libertee
s9_t2_end	You saw how I handle myself in the quarry; what made you think you'd be able to kill me?	s9_t2_end_00	3	0	libertee
s9_t2_end	If I *were* trying to kill you, why would I send Phineas to help you?	s9_t2_end_01	3	0	morbid

s9_t3_intro	It was a setup, all right.	s9_t3_intro_00	3	0	libertee
s9_t3_intro	As soon as we arrived, them slavers started poppin' out from under every damn rock.	s9_t3_intro_01	3	0	libertee
s9_t3_ending	Later, we found out the train had almost nothing of value.	s9_t3_ending_00	3	0	libertee
s9_t3_ending	But that pile o' corpses would certainly get us lots of Ether.	s9_t3_ending_01	3	0	libertee
	Tactical 9_4: GreenerPastures				
s9_t4_intro_pt1_solo	To get inside, I acted real pitiful. Pantomin' like I needed the doctors' help.	s9_t4_intro_pt1_solo	3	0	libertee
s9_t4_intro_pt1_bros	The plan was to get inside pretending Phineas and I were captives.	s9_t4_intro_pt1_bros	3	0	libertee

	Tactical 9_5: Cemetery Escape				
s9_t5_intro	The surgery was a triumph. And a resounding validation of my theories.	s9_t5_intro_00	3	1	morbid
s9_t5_intro	Unless I stabilized your grafts, though, it would all be for naught.	s9_t5_intro_01	3	1	morbid

s9_t5_valvesstart	For every rascal we eliminated, two more appeared. Fighting them individually was futile.	s9_t5_valvesstart_00	3	1	morbid
s9_t5_valvesstart	Quickly, I came up with a plan. If I overloaded the pump in the chapel it would distract them.	s9_t5_valvesstart_01	3	0	morbid
s9_t5_valvesshut	The trap was set. The pump explosion would knock everyone there unconscious.	s9_t5_valvesshut_00	3	1	morbid

s9_t6_deadbutether	The minions were dead, but the Ether was still flowing into the river.	s9_t6_deadbutether	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_ethersecured1	We closed the valve on the first tank. The trip would not be completely in vain.	s9_t6_ethersecured1	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_ethersecured2	The second valve was closed with some Ether still in the keg.	s9_t6_ethersecured2	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_ethersecured3	The final keg was now secure. We made quite a capable team.	s9_t6_ethersecured3	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_killremaining	All that remained was the unfortunate business of eliminating the witnesses.	s9_t6_killremaining	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_etherlost	The tanks were empty and the Ether floated downstream, useless to everyone.	s9_t6_etherlost	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_allkilled_etherplus	The Doctors' minions were dead and the Ether was secured.	s9_t6_allkilled_etherplus_00	3	0	morbid
s9_t6_allkilled_etherplus	It was a victory worthy of Nelson or Wellington.	s9_t6_allkilled_etherplus_01	3	0	morbid

s9_t7_intro	But has anyone? I at least empowered you to do your own bidding.	s9_t7_intro_01	3	2	morbid

s9_t7_foes	Duval's men, no doubt. It was... a setup.	s9_t7_foes_01	3	0	morbid

s9_t7_noduval_second_lib	He must be hiding.	s9_t7_noduval_second_lib	3	0	libertee
s9_t7_noduval_second_doc	No doubt he's skulking in the back somewhere, the coward.	s9_t7_noduval_second_doc	3	0	morbid
